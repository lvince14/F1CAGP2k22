## Attending the Grand Prix 🏁

We will be using Montreal's Metro network to [reach] the circuit. Once we exit the Parc Jean-Drapeau station we will be walking towards the **COSMOS** entrance.

Once we are at the circuit, for Friday only, we will be seating ourselves at one of the GA areas marked by the graph below. After a lengthy and careful research, it is discovered that very few spots allocated for general admission areas allow for an unplugged view of the most action packed parts of the track. On the other hand, this unfavorableness could be offset by the relatively small crowd size on Friday. We will also do our best to equip ourselves with various supplies and accessories(Lawn chairs, cooler, food and etc) to make sure we enjoy this experience to its fullest potential.

For Saturday, we will be seating in Grand stand 46. Our seats will be reserved therefore granting us the ability to roam around the track, shop for merchandise and participate in various off track [activities] that are offered.

Please try your best to learn the layout of the circuit as it is easier to navigate through the circuit and locate ourselves by calling out the corners and grandstands. ![alt text](https://www.formula1.com/content/dam/fom-website/2018-redesign-assets/Circuit%20maps%2016x9/Canada_Circuit.png.transform/9col/image.png)

> Note: Due to availability and resource constraints, we were unable to secure the most optimal and cost-efficient seats for the best possible viewing experience. ***Please adjust your expectations accordingly and understand that, this experience is only as good as what you can make of it.*** Enjoy the day, the atmosphere and the company. :)

## Other Events 🎉

The [Crescent Street Grand Prix Festival] is happening on June 16th(Thursday) to 18th(Saturday). There is no doubt this would be the ground zero for vibrant nightlife activities. We are very lucky to have our AirBnB booked right in the heart of the destination for race fans and the like.
